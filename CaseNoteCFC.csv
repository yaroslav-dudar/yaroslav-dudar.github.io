The information shared via the interview with Dee Dee seemed to support what was found in the file reviews.  In many files it was observed that families are receiving services in non-natural environments and the justifications indicated that non-natural enviornments were utilzed so families would not be waiting for services.  This  practice was clearly descibed by Dee Dee, and that she and her CFC agreed that they would provide non-natural environment services instead of placing children on a wait list.

Two of the issues  in question were; a physicians authorization without a child's name and a six month review that was not conducted.  During the exit Dee Dee questioned the monitor and continued to push that the six month review in question was not completed due to the famly not responsing to several attempts made by the Service Coordiantor.  The monitor gave several examples in the file where this six month could have happened but did not.  Dee Dee continued to try and find examples of the family being unavailable. After 20 minutes of back and fourth I made the decision to remove  the violation based on a two documented attempts to conduct a six month review.  This same file also had violations for changing services without a meeting and no justification to change services.  At this time, the integrity of policy and procedure was highlighted for Dee Dee and her staff that were present at the exit meeting.

I reiterated the companion document is what drives our decsion and it was explained that we work with DHS to find areas in which credit for implemeting procedures can be given and when certain federal requiremnts do not give credit when  attempts have been made.  The CFC staff continued to ask questions about exit/transition meetings that could not be completed because a family disappears or leaves the system  without notince.

Jackie shared that she has had several service coordinators out on maternity leave and she is filling in for them and she has been reallreally busy and barely able to keep up with all the meetings.  Jackie then brought up a concern, not rerlated to t he review, but that she had two heat tickets that were denied by her DHS specialist.  The heat tickets were related to mistakes that were made at the CFC level but Jackie feels that her error should not impact the providers because she is working to cover several caseloads and failed to make a changes that was needed.  I explained to JAckie that I understand her concern, but it is the repsonsiblity of providers to check and ensure they have authorization before they provide any service.

Jackie was still upset about the situation, so I told her that maybe she should put all of her concerns and describe her current situation in writting and send it on to Janet.

The Challenge Ellana had a problem with stated: Primary language documented on the IFSP is not clear (example: one file reviewed stated primary language as English - but authorizations for interpretation were issued for on-going speech services).  Ellana stated there was a case note stating "mom going back to work and grandma would be the primary-care giver and would need an interpreter because grandma speaks Spanish."  Ellana stated it was clearly documented and maybe one of the monitors overlooked the case note.  I explained to Ellana that in the past it was an issue with CFC's putting English as the primary language but issuing auths for interpreters.  Ellana stated it was clearly case noted and it is not an issue and she will address it as such.  Ellana also stated that she did not want to address something that was documented and felt that an IFSP meeting should not have to re-convene to change the language on the IFSP.  I explained to Ellana that monitors only document what they see and if an interpreter is needed it should be listed on the IFSP.  Ellana stated that it was nothing for this writer to defend because it was clearly documented in the case notes why an interpreter was needed and will not correct something that doesn't need correcting.  Ellana also went on to say that she will not address services coordinators regarding this matter so that monitoring want seem like a Joke.  Ellana went on to explain that she will address the challenges as monitors overlooked case note and it is not a challenge.  This writer stated address the challenge as you see fit and then asked if she had any other questions regarding the report - Ellana stated, no.

Explained the process as follows:

1)  File Reviews by the CFC Staff.  30 files will be generated by Blake - with at least 4 files from each full time service coordinator - less for a part time coordinator.  Prior to on-site review, service coordinators will be asked to complete the file review tool.

2)  Monitors will verify the file data collected by the service coordinators during the on-site review.  At least 75% of files will be verified.

3) Will be interviewing at 50% of service coordinators - through individual, group or written interviews.

4) Will be interviewing CFC Program Manager.

5) Will be doing surveys of providers, stakeholders and parents.

On-site review will be held on the following days and times;

Monday, December 12 - 10:30-4:30
Tuesday, December 13 - 8:30-2:30

There will be three monitors coming on the review, possibly 4.

I will be sending out a confirmation letter and informational packet the week of October 24.  Files for Review names will be sent the week of October 31 - if at all possible.  I will inform Cara Allen if either of these things change.

CFC Identified Strengths:

**Gathering Child Outcomes Data
**Internal Database to track due dates
**Seasoned Service Coordinators - Low turnover
**Good working transition agreements

CFC Identified Challenges:

**IFSP teams rating children too high for child outcomes
**Writing appropriate functional outcomes and strategies
**Consistency of services throughout area - seems providers in Quad Cities area recommend more
**Getting reports from certain providers
**Providers not attending 6 month meetings

Suggestions from CFC:

**Survey families and providers during annual monitoring
**Reconsider the need for meetings to reduce/end services
**Help with certain providers who seem to always recommend more services and who always seem to have all children just eligible for services.

Follow Up/Other Observations by Chelsea:

**Under Age One participation - ranked 24/25 - Cara Allen has said that a lot of Pre-K/3-5 Programs have lost funding for screenings. And plus her staff have reduced their hours due to budget cuts - so less time for screenings.
**Overall participation from August 09 to September 11 - have lost 60 kids and went from staffing 8.4 service coordinators to 7.6.  Monitoring should definitely focus on this during the monitoring visit - look at referral sources and talk to Cara Allen.","54226","","11/14/2011 10:39:11 AM",

Gary and I have discussed this situation before.  His concern is that children are not being referred to EI - either not at all or much later than they should.  This can cause parents to be upset because some services are free in EI and it can save the parent money to be referred to the EI system.

Gary thinks part of the problem is that the parties involved have a different definition of what is medical and what is developmental. He also thinks that he needs to work more closely with physicians in the CFC area to understand what is a developmental concern that should be referred to EI first.

It was a good conversation and I then contacted Sara Hamilton at IPMR and discussed the situation with her.  She is relatively new to EI and just wants to do the right thing.  Discussed CFC concerns and encouraged her to be in contact with Gary.

Completed exit w/ Program Mgr and Exec. Director.  Explained #11 in regards to the implementation of the previous years CAP and how the state wants us to approach this question.  Let Polly know about the 6 month follow-up that will take place.  I went over report areas of improvement from the previous year as well as violations.  They did not have any questions or choose to look through files.  Polly said she had an idea about why there was a large concentration of violations in #'s 38-41.  I explained that SC do not need to wait for reports to write IFSPs.  They should be taking their laptops to IFSP meetings, and they can write the IFSP at that time.  She understood this.  Gave Prog.

Jim had a lot of questions about what this review is trying to find out and was feeling that this was duplicative of the information already given to DHS to make determination scores and that the CFC already writes a CAP for that process.  I assured Jim that this process is more in-depth and is meant to help the CFC really look at how business is being conducted and what can be changed to make the process run smoothly based on the law.

Maggie stated that she feels strongly that some areas of this CFC have been very provider driven and provider focused.  She wants the CFC to move away from this - as the focus should always be the children and families.

We discussed eligibility and how to use the results/implication section of the reports - especially in the arena evaluations.  I told her that I would send her the January 2008 Eligiblity memo from DHS to provider some clarification.

We talked a lot about the fact that there are going to be issues that will show up on the next monitoring due to things that did not happen by previous fiscal agent during transition.  I told her that we are very aware that there are things that she will not be able to "fix" or clean up.  At this point, I recommended that she look towards the future and spend her energy on that - not the past errors as much.

I told her that based on the discussion that we were having - she was already emphasizing the things that will help the CFC's performance - importance of case noting; the importance of a good file review system, and an involved Program Manager.

"000000017","9/5/2012","11:05:43 AM","LMILWARD","General Inquiry","Received phone call today from Karla Richmond, Program Manager.  She had a question concerning AT requests and the functional outcomes page of the IFSP.  With a few recent AT requests, Colleen Cunningham at DHS sent back the request and stated that the IFSP needed to be redone.  This was due to the fact that the AT needs were documented on the right hand side of the outcome page as a part of the six month review meeting.  Colleen stated that a new outcome for AT needed to be developed and that monitoring would be looking closely at this if it is not done this way.

I told Karla that I was not aware of that type of requirement - that the monitors would be looking to see that AT need is appropriately related to a functional outcome and is documented on the IFSP (CFC Procedural Manual July 2012 Section 12.16.1.  And that as far as I know, there has been no other new requirements that we have been told.

Karla is frustrated by this and the amount of extra work it is creating.  She also wonders if it is being done consistently throughout the state.  She would like to take it to Amy Tarr, but isn't sure if it would be helpful or harmful.

I reiterated that we monitor based on the rules and regulations, which do not seem to require that a new outcome be written to address the AT needs.  However, if Colleen at DHS is saying they have to do something to get the AT request approved - she is probably going to have to do what Colleen wants.

In the midst of the conversation, Karla also mentioned that she had lost two staff this summer, but was able to rehire staff that left in the past few years to have children.  She is also awaiting the RFP and was curious if I knew anything it or about the YahaSoft system being done away with.  She heard that the YahaSoft hasn't died completely, but that it was taking a different direction.

I told her I didn't really know anything about the RFP or YahaSoft.  I told her I would follow up a bit on the AT and get back to her in a few days with any additional information I can find out.

1) If two providers do evaluations and show the child has 28% delay and mark not eligible, but then the team discusses and it is decided that it is the clinical judgment of the team that the child is eligible, should the providers go back and change their report.  The answer is no, they should not change the reports.  The service coordinator needs to document in case notes and eligibility letter that the child was determined eligible by clinical opinoin of the team.

2) Her service coordinators usually enter the PA35 (eligibility reasons) when they receive the reports from the providers.  Maria said that they should wait to do this after the IFSP meeting - due to team discussion.  I concurred with Maria that this would be best practice - as individual providers do not determine eligibility - it is determined by the team.

"000000017","1/28/2014","1:41:04 PM","LMILWARD","General Inquiry","Karla called today - she had some questions after looking at the file reviews.  We played phone tag most of the day - and finally were able to connect.

Her questions/comments had to do with service coordinators automatically giving providers an authorization for a six month evaluation/assessment.  I reminded her of what DHS has stated about this and she agreed, but she also said she could not find it in writing that the CFC could not give this auth.  I agreed with her, because as I was looking for it to reference in her report - I also could not find it.  So, I really can't hold her to the verbal issue that was given to not automatically do a full blown evaluation at six months.

Karla would argue that many times, completing a six month evaluation can save money because if the child is no longer showing delays, they move them out of EI right then.

The other issue was whether or not adding DT group was considered increasing DT services.  If yes, does a justification need to be completed?  I am in discussion with DHS about this right now.  Karla mentioned that the only group that they have in her area is a music group that meets in the Fall and Spring.  Would it be okay to add this group to the IFSP when it is written - saying when the group is going to be starting?  I think that this would be appropriate if the service is related to the child's functional outcomes.

Overall, a good conversation - just what Focused should be getting at.  I forgot to ask her about whether or not the group was being authed in the natural environment, will ask the next time I speak with her.

There was one finding due to a provider performing an evaluation in her office, but her authorization was for home.  This is a violation, but more importantly, a great concern as the service coordinator stated that this provider will just randomly decide to provide services (both direct and evals) in her office, even though she is authorized for the home.  I explained to the service coordinator that this cannot happen for several reasons - there is a rate difference and there is natural environment data that is being skewed.  The monitoring program will follow up with this provider - Jan Ala - to explain it to her and to note it so that we can be looking for this in her annual monitoring reviews.

Concern was noted that lots of phone meetings with parent and service coordinator are held to add/increase or change services.","78393","","4/3/2014 11:33:51 AM",
"000000017","4/2/2014","11:15:58 AM","LMILWARD","Meeting","Second day of review conducted by Leigh, Caryn and Beth at the Quincy office.  Arrived at 8:45 and completed review at 3:30.  

Findings included Section 3, #6 - that there was no effort by the service coordinator to have the IFSP team meet as a group to discuss progress and outcomes for an exit meeting.  The other finding included not documenting progress for the transition goal at the six month review meeting.  There were concerns, but no findings, about the amount of phone meetings that occurred to add/drop/change services.

Other areas that need to be researched and followed up on include the following:

1) Music Group - does there need to be a meeting of the entire team to add this service?  Does a justification need to be completed to increase services?  The group is held at a church, can this be authorized in the natural environment?

2) There is a speech therapist who will not serve children who have insurance.  How can the CFC handle this?  Provider is Debbie Staten.

3)  When does the NE worksheet need to be completed?  This CFC uses a 51% rule - that is more than 50% of services are not in NE - then they do the sheet.  This monitor thought it was if ANY service is being provided in non-NE.  Will check on this and get back to CFC.  Also, how should CFCs check yes/no on the IFSP outcome page if some services are in NE and some are not?

Exit meeting was conducted with monitors, Karla Richmond and Kara - who will be the Program Manager when Karla retires in the fall.","78394","","4/3/2014 11:36:03 AM",

In regards to evals, I clarified that providers have 14 days from receipt of the authorization (which is the begin date of the auth unless noted) to complete the eval and get the report to the CFC.  This is a violation during monitoring, but there are no financial repercussions if it is not done.  We brainstormed ideas to get reports in a more timely manner, including possibly holding the initial IFSP meeting auth until the report is received.  I told her that I didn't think there was anything that said she couldn't do this...I will contact DHS to see if they have any other ideas.

In regards to the consultation model, I explained that if a child needs speech, and there is no speech available, must go on waiting list.  If a provider can provide services one time a month, they could then consult with the DT by doing co-treatment or talking with them to give them suggestions on general developmental activities that can enhance speech - but can't be speech specific - must be something that all disciplines can do.

One service coordinator wants template of tool emailed to her so that she can type it.  I will do that today or tomorrow.

In the course of the meeting, several topics were discussed:

**As far as natural environments is concerned, service coordinators say that the lack of an "acceptable" reason to have services in the non-natural environment makes them feel like they are not doing their job well.  But in many cases, the child would wait for services if they aren't offered in a clinic or the parent would prefer to have services in the clinic.  This writer definitely sensed some confusion and disagreement with the definition and philosophy of natural environment.

**Lisa McGlothlin mentioned that a therapist at St. Johns recently told her that it is not unusual that parents bringing children to the clinic for therapy don't even leave the waiting room - the child goes back for therapy and the parent is not involved.  This is a BIG concern for this writer and needs to be talked to further with Lisa McGlothlin in the future.

**Jeremy Allison is now named Isaiah Bramer on the Files for Review List.  I will make that change.

**Service Coordinators asked if they need to include the standard service coordination outcome that this CFC includes in every IFSP on the Focused Monitoring Tool.  I told them NO - they do not need to do that - only the outcomes that are individualized for each child.

**Eileen told the Program Managers that they must start to immediately have a transition outcome page in every IFSP.  Lisa asked if we will monitor for this in the Focused and the Compliance verification - I said it should not apply - as the files pulled for both of these reviews will be prior to Eileen saying this on 12-15-11.

1) Dr. Morgan was recommending an increase in PT services in a diagnostic report.  I reiterated to Lisa that there are to be no service recommendations in the reports - she is aware of that and stated that they tell families that just because it is in the report does not mean that the IFSP team will agree or that EI will pay for the services recommended in the report.  I told Lisa that we are monitoring for this and will be trying to take care of it as we see it.

2) A child was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, so the SC stopped feeding and nutrition services, because the diagnosis made these services medical, not developmental.  The SC wanted to know if a justification to reduce services needed to be completed and DHS said NO.  The situation should be case noted and there needs to be meeting held to discuss this with the IFSP team; this meeting should also be case noted.","55375","","12/20/2011 1:39:41 PM",

The SC's at this CFC are doing very odd things, such as having initial IFSP meetings with no providers present or calling in, conducting the Intake and the IFSP back to back on the same day,  There was one file where the casenote states the 6 month review was cancelled, however, section 3 of the IFSP was updated on the date of the cancelled meeting.  Another file has documentation to support that an IFSP meeting was held, the casenote states that the parents are unable to be contacted.  There is one case where a consent form was dated prior to when the child was referred.

We worked all day and left at 4:00PM.  We still have over half the files left to do tomorrow.  Each file is very time consuming as nothing is clear and it is difficult to figure out between conflicting casenotes and documentation what actually occurred.","60188","","7/13/2012 11:14:58 AM",
"000000018","5/3/2012","11:14:58 AM","TLANGFOR","Correspondence","Day two of review.  Today Alicia joined us from the Homewood office.  At one point it appeared that Lisa might be pre-screening the referrals.  Alicia and I took some files to Lisa's office to have her look through and we casually brought up the subject of referrals. Lisa told us that she takes all the referrals and then contacts the family first to make sure they want services.  She does not assign referrals to her staff until she is sure the family really does want to participate in EI.  We did not say anything at this time but will discuss it with Leigh and see how she wants to proceed.

We finished the files around 2:00.  Today there was more of the oddities along with a lot of other findings for missing forms, service delay, no requests for reports prior to the 6 month review and no monthly contact with families.  These are just some examples, there are many more findings.  When presented to Lisa, she appeared very surprised and disappointed.  It seems as though all these things were happening but she was not aware of the situation.

Myself, Leigh and Alicia held the exit with Lisa and all of the Service Coordinators.  There were lots of questions and the exit took about an hour.  Each SC wanted to look through their files and challenge the findings.  Leigh told them they could do so and get back to her by phone or fax.  But right now the report will stand as is.

At the training, providers were told that they should not be putting a range of age equivalency on their evaluation reports - that they should be putting a specific age equivalency.  Providers have concerns about this because some of the evaluation tools only give a range - not a specific age equivalency.

I told Lisa that for monitoring purpose, we do not look at age equivalency.  What we do look at is percent of delay.  And some tools do give a range of percent of delay - instead of a specific number.  We have told providers that if they are using a range of delay on the evaluation report that if the range starts at less than a 30% delay - they must use E03 to find the child eligible in the "Results/Implications" Section.

I told that yes, it should be done.  This is required due to the fact that the child was receiving speech services 1x/week, but now will be getting an increase in speech services.

Debbie also mentioned that she heard from a service coordinator that a parent told her that Barb Utz is still doing the ongoing evaluations for children that she is not providing direct service for.

Section 3.6 under activities implemented toward future compliance does not correlate with the violation. It looks like it was accidently cut/pasted from the previous violation. 
2.  Also, since there were two reports the CAP addressed the vilolations the same way. So, for the open files section 1.5 was not addressed, but it was addressed for the closed files. Need to see if this is okay. 
3. Section 2.7 violation was mislabled as section 1.7. need to verify if this is okay
4. With the new directives number five asks that barries be explained for previous violations. This was done, but not for all the previous findings.

If a PT finds no delay, but does see concerns in S/E areas for the child and the DT finds a 50% delay in S/E area, the CFC should contact DHS to request permission to have a S/E evaluation completed to determine eligibility for early intervention.  This is done through an email to Colleen Cunningham and Jennifer Kepner.  Once permission is granted, the S/E evaluation can be completed and the IFSP team can meet to determine eligibility and write the IFSP.

I had to leave this on a voice mail for Pete, as I wanted him to  have the answer and I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday.  Left him my cell number in case he needed to contact me.","54895","","12/9/2011 2:39:37 PM",
"000000020","12/9/2011","2:36:06 PM","CTRIPP","Correspondence","Peter Niccum called and had a few questions. First question: child referred for gross motor - DT delay in social emotional 50% and the PT eval no delay, but agrees with the DT regarding a social emotional delay. They wanted to know what the PT needed to do. I stated that the PT would not amend their eval or use clinical opinon since the PT's tool does not test for social emotional. This would be a team decision of clinical judgment and it would be documented in the service coordinator's notes and reflected on the IFSP. I thought this was the best answer given social emotional cannot determine eligibility. The next question was asked about recommendations. They reported that their providers were saying they could not recommend evaluations for other disciplines in the evals. I stated they could and the format allows you to do so. I went over what was considered a recommendation. Barb asked the question about recommending a certain discipline in an eval. I stated that would be a recommendation because a specific service is being recommended. Barb had another question regarding clinical opinion. She asked if 30 percent delay had to be referenced in the justification for clinical judgement. I said it needs to address the two questions and that is what we looked for. We do not require a percentage in the justification. I told them if I would go over this with Leigh and if there was anything different she would follow up with them. Leigh said that the social emotional could determine eligibility with approval from DHS. Leigh followed up with him regarding the error. ","55113","","12/9/2011 2:55:22 PM",

I explained again the answer that DHS had given regarding the scenario where a DT finds a 50% delay in Social/Emotional and the PT also saw S/E concerns.  Pete did not have a problem with this, but he did ask what about if it was an area where there were no S/E providers.  I told him that he could then use provisional providers - or contact DHS for a special - one time exemption.

Pete also asked for feed back on the idea that the CFC could have a letter that would be sent to providers if evaluation report was not sent to the CFC in a timely manner.  There would be some type of policy that states that if a provider receives 3 such letters in a certain time period - the CFC could take further action - remove from evaluator list, etc. I told Pete that I would check with DHS and get back to him.","55376","","12/20/2011 2:27:22 PM",

Jenese called back.  First, she confirmed that she got my message yesterday regarding the six month CAP follow up - she will be working on this and will submit by deadline.

Second, she discussed that she has always encouraged providers to use the EI system supports - parent liaison, LIC Coordinator, SE Consultant, Medical Diagnostic Consultant and service coordinators.  She has never spoken to them about billing and stated that she wasn't aware that they could bill for talking to these people.  I explained that if they are listed on the IFSP, they can bill for talking with them, with the exception of the the LIC Coordinator.  She explained that Kristi Schwatner, the medical diagnostic liaison is supposed to be listed on the front page of the IFSP for all children - as a resource for providers and family. For this particular child, the service coordinator did not list the medical diagnostics.

This explanation makes sense to me and she said that if providers have billing questions - she always tells them to call us. For this particular provider, it appears that she was doing the service coordinator's job by calling the medical diagnostics to make the referral - and this is the service coordinator's job.  She could have talked with them after the referral was made and it would have been more appropriate.","55881","","1/6/2012 11:47:04 AM",

It is a difficult time, but all the service coordinators and herself are very committed to doing the best job possible.  With this being said, she would like to have the opportunity to sit down and talk with me about monitoring - the tool, the expectations, etc.  I told her that I would be happy to come and meet with her and discuss the monitoring tool and any other questions that she may have.  She is going to check with Bill Ferguson and get back to me with a date for the week of November 12.

She had a few questions for today.  Question #1) What do they need to send to providers/families?  CFC 21 seems to send everything - she would like to streamline the process.  We also had a conversation about how the CFC also keeps multiple copies of paperwork in their files and that they don't need to.  She is aware of that and it is something that is also being worked on.  Question #2) At the six month review, what should be put on the update of the functional outcomes section of the IFSP?  Should it be more than just "continue" or "complete".  I explained to Nicole that we started giving technical assistance on this a few years ago - that we would like to see more than just one word.  She said that the CFC 21 service coordinators stated that they were not aware of this.  I told Nicole that due to all of the other issues during compliance monitoring, this one was probably not yet addressed.  It is something that she can and should address with the service coordinators.

Nicole is still very concerned that the monitoring for this year is not going to look very good.  I told her that the monitoring program and DHS are aware that this is going to be a process to get the CFC in good working order and that it is to be expected that this year's monitoring will not show vast improvement, due to the fact that we are looking at older files.  I stated to Nicole that I think it will be the 2014 monitoring where the improvement will be seen and that I will be happy to talk with her service coordinators about this when we are there for monitoring.

Our discussion was very good and very positive. Nicole is hopeful that she is going to maintain staff - staff turnover has been a big problem.  The new fiscal agent has provided raises and benefits - which helps moral, etc.  Nicole already knows that she is going to have a bit of an uphill battle in earning the trust/respect of the providers in her CFC.  She continues to be positive with providers and is making changes that are necessary under the updated CFC Procedural Manual.

We talked about what documents need to be sent out to parents and providers. I told her this was still unclear, but to continue to send what she as been sending.  She said that there are so many letters floating around, she wanted to know which letters to send.  After a long discussion, she said that she is going to use the letters/send out what CFC 24 did, for the most part.

As far as monitoring goes, I reiterated to her that I don't expect to see huge improvement this year, due to the fact that we have to pull closed files.  I told her not to worry about this - the improvement will come!!

I am going to send her copies of 2011 and 2012 report and Corrective Action Plans.

I told her that we would do five written interviews for Focused Verification on the first day and that I would be available from 9-10 am at the St. Louis Bread Co. on the second day to talk with anyone who would like to have an informal group interview.  I will move her interview to 10:30 am on the second day.

I will send out a final agenda to her via email in the next few days.

She had a few questions.  First, she wanted to know if she needed to send the rights booklet with every letter that she sends out - I told her no, that she could include a sentence in the letter to state the booklet is available upon request.

Second, she said that several provider have told her that the EI Monitoring Program requires a separate printing of the auths - that we don't accept the auths in the IFSP.  I told her that this was not ture - that probably something had been misunderstood at some point in time.  I told her that she did n't need to do that and the providers can call me if they have questions about this.","65747","","12/20/2012 2:11:01 PM",

Since the Provider Handbook states that provider's can communicate via email, I contacted Bill to see if there had been policy changes made that we were not aware of.

Bill stated that at the most recent CFC Manager's meeting with DHS, it was stated that texts and emails containing PHI are HIPAA violations.  Bill, in turn, told his service coordinators that if any of them are found to have committed a HIPAA violation (shared PHI via text or email), they would be fired.  Because it is so hard to know exactly what might be determined to be PHI, his service coordinators have told providers that they (SC) will no longer be communicating via email or text.
 
Bill said that he has not made any statements to providers about whether or not they can text or email.
 
I spoke with Blake Whitson at DHS and he said that the newest version of the CFC Procedural Manual is very specific about HIPAA violations and texting, emailing, etc. With the increased use of cell phones and tablets, there is a statement in the manual that states that Portable Electronic Devices are not an acceptable form of communication in Early Intervention.

I explained to Karen Williams that we do see CFCs that will auth for 3x/month and then use the comment section to explain that this is every other week services, with the 3x/month allowing for those months with an extra week.

It is the team's decision on whether services should be every other week or 2X/month.  If every other week is decided on, Karen stated that she will tell her service coordinators to auth for 3x/month and use the comment section as stated above.

I told her that I have spoken with DHS about this and they are okay with this practice.  Karen was concerned that providers do the every other week for consistency and scheduling - not so much by the needs of the child.  I agreed that this might sometimes be the case, but if the team decides that every other week is best, it is okay by DHS to auth for 3x a month and use the comment section to state every other week.

The provider stated that service coordinators were asking speech therapists to add the following statement to their report:

"I recommend DT services for this child."

This was being asked when a child showed a 30% delay on the DT evaluation (I do not know what area the delay was found in - this information was not shared), but the ST did not find a 30% delay.  The service coordinator was asking the provider to put this statement on so the child could get services.

I explained to Karen that providers are not to be putting recommendations for services on their reports and that we are monitoring for this.  She said that this might be happening so the child can get services.  We talked about the January 2008 memo and that if the DT found a greater than 30% delay in language and the ST did not - the child is not eligible for services.  The family can always re-refer if concerns continue.

We also talked about that if the DT found a greater than 30% delay in an area other than language - the following could occur:  

If the delay was in the cognitive area, the team could find the child eligible based on clinical opinion of the team.  If the delay was in gross motor, a PT should be brought in to do an evaluation to deternine if the child has a greater than 30% delay in gross motor.

Karen said that she was going to pull out the 2008 memo and review it with her staff again - that it is definitely an area that is easily mis-understood.  I agreed and told her to call me with any questions or concerns.","53618","","10/20/2011 9:59:37 AM",

*Service Coordinator using Focused Tool to review their own files.  Tool to be used will be sent with confirmation letter and Files for Review list.
*Monitors will verify the tool by reviewing the files while on site.
*Interviews will occur with three service coordinators (there are only 4).  These interviews will be a combination of written and face-to-face.

*Surveys/Interviews of providers and LEA reps.

We picked the dates of February 7 and 8, 2013.  We will arrive at noon on February 7 and work until 4:30.

I will send the confirmation letter, along with the tool, Files for Review list, summary of the process, and a tentative agenda as soon as I get the children's names from Blake.

She had a question about providers who are using the Batelle to evaluate preemies.  The Batelle does not adjust age for preemies and it says that it is not to be used to evaluate preemies (according to Deanna).  She stated that it appears that the DTs are using the Batelle, then using the Alpen-Boll and putting those results into the Batelle to have it be adjusted for preemie age.  I am unsure of how the DT is writing this up, but it appears that they are not including the Alpen-Boll in the report.

Deanna wants to know if it is okay to use both of these tools to determine eligibility and if so, how is the report supposed to be written.

Since I am not a clinician, I am going to contact Chelsea Guillen to see what she thinks about this situation.  I will contact Deanna with information once I have communicated with Chelsea.","56701","","2/6/2012 9:13:38 AM",
